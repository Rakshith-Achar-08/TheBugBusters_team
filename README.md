GlassFund flips the script by ensuring that:  

- **Administrators** manage budgets responsibly.  
- **Auditors** verify without friction.  
- **The Public** finally sees where their contributions go.  

We believe that **data is not just numbers—it’s trust.**

it’s about **trust between people and institutions**.
