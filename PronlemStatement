##Our Challenge: 
    Build a solution that brings clarity and trust to
    how money flows in institutions. The system
    should:
        1. Make the movement of funds easy to
        follow and understand, showing how a
        budget gets divided into departments,
        projects, and vendors.
        2. Make this information easy to understand
        for everyone, from citizens and students
        to parents and other stakeholders.
        3. Ensure the data is authentic, traceable,
        and reliable, so people know they can          
        trust it.
